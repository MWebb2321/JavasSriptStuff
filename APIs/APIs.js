// User interfaces allow humans to interact with programs.
// Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) let programs (including scripts) talk to each other.

// Types of APIs

// REST APIs
// REST APIs, also known as RESTful APIs, stand for Representational State Transfer.
// REST APIs have grown in popularity of late, as a part of Web Services.
// REST APIs are designed for developers to perform requests and receive responses via HTTP functions.
// There are four different HTTP commands that REST are based on. These include GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.
// When you pull up Instagram and search for the latest and greatest meme of the day, that app is using a REST API.

// SOAP APIs
// SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.
// While REST is an architectural style, SOAP is a protocol which is defined by a standard.
// SOAP is dependent on XML-based systems and programming, tending to have larger, more expensive data.
// SOAP APIs also provide a higher level of security.
// A common use case is an application interacting with a financial institution.

// RCP APIs
// RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call.
// RPC APIs were the earliest form of APIs, as they are designed to execute a block of code on a different server.
// When it is used over HTTP, it can become a Web API.
